# Build the Geekity Explore image for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 and push it to
# the GitHub Container Registry as ghcr.io/geekitycom/explore.
#
# This is the only way an image gets published. Nothing in CI pushes one, on
# purpose: a published tag is what the server pulls, so publishing stays a
# maintainer's step after a release, as it is for the Geekity CMS image. buildx
# builds both platforms here and pushes them as one manifest list.
#
# The version tag comes from the root package.json, which release-please
# bumps when its release pull request is merged. The usual order is: merge the
# release pull request, `git pull` on main, then run this. `latest` is pushed
# alongside the version, and so is a custom tag when one is given.
#
# Usage (from the repository root):
#
#   scripts/docker-build-push.sh [--dry-run] [CUSTOM_TAG]
#   pnpm docker:build-push [CUSTOM_TAG]
#   pnpm docker:dry-run [CUSTOM_TAG]
#
# --dry-run prints what would be built and pushed, and builds, pushes, logs in
# and runs the quality gates not at all.
